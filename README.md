The main goal was to create a fast, responsive search experience while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

### Built With

*   **React** (with TypeScript)
*   **Vite**
*   **Zustand** for global state management
*   **Tailwind CSS** for styling
*   **Vitest** & **React Testing Library** for testing
